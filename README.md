Satellites or other remote sensing objects generates enormous quantities of data per hour/day/week/month/year.
In 2022-23 the NISAR mission (the most ambitious satellite-radar program to be launched) is going to generate 85 TB of data each day. 

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a great place to get quality data of this type through their javascript code editor or python API.
Here are some of my favorites (OLCI/Sentinel 3 or Aqua/MODIS) and other elements which are very useful for the new era of Earth and Ocean studies.
